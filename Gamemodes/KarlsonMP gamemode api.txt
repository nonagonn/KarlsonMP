KarlsonMP gamemode api

There are 5 functions you should overload in your class
ProcessMessage(messageBase) - new riptide message. you can write handlers with dictionary and using messageBase.RiptideId
OnPlayerDisconnect(ushort id) - player disconnect
OnStart() - server / gamemode start
OnStop() - server / gamemode stop
ServerTick() - ran by server update loop at TPS

there's also message builder and you can build and send out riptide messages. good luck!

also you can use taskscheduler because i've already made one so you don't have to re-invent the wheel bozo
